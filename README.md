# Course Page: Modern Image Search for Super AI Development Program SS4
by Romrawin Chumpu (Jin) - Super AI SS1

Hello everyone! Welcome to the short course on image search. This repository is a collection of codes, demos, and examples throughout the course.Â Feel free to download anything you find useful here. 

**Welcome Note** - This course might be a little deep for some of you who might jump into image for the first time. I will try to accommodate the basic parts and keywords of each topic. So, you can capture some brief concepts and continue with your advanced interests later on. For those of you who love images or are already in the field, I am sure this would be a fun course. For those of you who hate images, try to imagine along with me first; you might find something interesting. That's all I have to say. I hope you have some fun, and welcome to my image world!
